# XPathStudio
XPathStudio 


Tool to improve searching local and remote eventlogs. Collects XPath queries in an .json format that is available for selection in a list.
Run against you local machine or a list of hosts. Do your filtering in XPath and/or in the Display Filter option.

Have a couple of Sysmon Xpath queries available. If you have your own please share and I will update the .json file.

#### Remember that you need to run the script as an elevated admin to read the Security and Sysmon log.
