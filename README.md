# XPathStudio
XPathStudio 


A tool to simplify searching local and remote eventlogs.0 Has a collection of XPath queries in an .json file that is available for selection in a list.
Run against you local machine or a list of hosts. Do your filtering in XPath and/or in the Display Filter option.

Have a couple of Sysmon Xpath queries available. If you have your own please share and I will update the .json file.

#### Remember that you need to run the script as an elevated admin to read the Security and Sysmon log.
#### This is not a log collector! No database is used so if a lot data is retrieved performance will be affected.
